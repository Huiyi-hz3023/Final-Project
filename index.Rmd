## Motivation
New York sells itself on vibrant public life—but a city’s real magnetism shows up in how well it shares its spaces and resources. Understanding what drives public participation in community events is essential for effective urban planning and equitable resource allocation. NYC Parks hosts thousands of special events each year, yet attendance varies widely across neighborhoods, seasons, and program types. These patterns matter because well-attended events strengthen community engagement, promote physical activity, and ensure that public resources are used efficiently. At the same time, imbalances in participation may reflect disparities in accessibility or programming that does not fully meet community needs. By identifying the conditions associated with higher participation, we aim to provide insights that can help guide more inclusive and effective public programming in New York City.
