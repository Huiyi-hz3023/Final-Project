## The tentative project title

ParkScope — Patterns, People, and Places in NYC Special Events

## The motivation for this project

## The intended final products

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
Descriptive statistics: Descriptive analyses of NYC Parks special
events, focusing on event types, frequency, duration, and geographic
distribution across boroughs and seasons.  
Visualization: Summarize how event activity varies by time of year, park
location, and event category.

**Spatial and Temporal Analysis** Using mapping tools and time-series
visualizations, we will explore spatial clustering and seasonal trends
in park events. This analysis will identify whether certain boroughs or
neighborhoods host more frequent events and how park activity changes
over time.

**Equity and Accessibility Assessment** Using demographic and population
data from the U.S. Census and NYC Open Data, we will evaluate the
relationship between event locations and neighborhood characteristics
(e.g., population density, socioeconomic indicators). This analysis will
help assess whether public events are equitably distributed among
communities.

## The anticipated data sources

Dataset will be the *Parks Special Events* from *NYC Open Data*. This
data set includes detailed information on public events held in New York
City parks.  
Relevant indices:  
–Group Name/Partner  
–Borough  
–Location  
–Event Name & Type  
–Attendance
